Here are Cellbow's ImageJ plugin and a python source code.

Using microscope to study cells growing and dividing is one of the common tasks in a biological lab. However, having taken the pictures of the cells is only half way through. A challenging and often time-consuming work is to recognize, label and track each individual cell from the raw image. These images usually vary greatly in their features and qualities depending on the focal field, experimental conditions, cell types, different labs, etc. Current methods are very limited to solve these generic problems. Here we employed a machine learning method to develop a robust software that is automated, flexible and customizable for this task.
